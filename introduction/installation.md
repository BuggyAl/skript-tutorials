# Installation

Installing Skript is no different from any other plugin. You download the latest jar file, which can be found at [https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases). You should ensure your server meets the requirements for running Skript:

* A Spigot, Paper, or Paper fork server jar. Spigot is the absolute minimum and Skript includes some features that are only accessible when using Paper or a fork of Paper.
* Minecraft Version. Currently, 2.6.3 works for 1.9 - 1.19, but 2.7 will only work for 1.13+.&#x20;
  * 1.8 support can be found [here](https://github.com/Matocolotoe/Skript-1.8/releases), but is not official, nor recommended, nor guaranteed to work.

After you've downloaded the jar file, put it in your `plugins` folder in your server directory. Restart the server and Skript should generate the folder `plugins/Skript`.&#x20;

Inside should be some files, `config.sk`, and the folder `scripts`. The `scripts` folder should have a folder of example scripts inside it. These are very useful for understanding how scripts are written.
