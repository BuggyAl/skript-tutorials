# Installation

Installing Skript is no different from any other plugin. You download the latest jar file, which can be found at [https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases).&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
You should ensure your server meets the requirements for running Skript:

* A Spigot, Paper, or Paper fork server jar. Spigot is the absolute minimum and Skript includes some features that are only accessible when using Paper or a fork of Paper.
* Minecraft Version. Skript 2.7 works for versions 1.13+.&#x20;
  * 1.8 support can be found [here](https://github.com/Matocolotoe/Skript-1.8/releases), but is not official, nor recommended, nor guaranteed to work.
  * 1.9-1.12 support is limited to old versions of Skript that do not receive updates (2.6.4)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

After you've downloaded the jar file, put it in your `plugins` folder in your server directory. Restart the server and Skript should generate the folder `plugins/Skript`.&#x20;

Inside should be some files, `config.sk`, and the folder `scripts`. The `scripts` folder should have a folder of example scripts inside it. These are very useful for understanding how scripts are written.

You can take some time to read through them, or you can move directly on to making your first script.
