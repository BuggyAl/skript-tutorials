Skript has a very powerful variable variant called lists which allow you to store multiple values and access them as a group, loop through them, or just get them by themselves.





Go back over list basics, talk about tiers/recursive lists

give examples for ways to use lists, indices of lists, how to format the list to make it easiest to use

Talk about using indices to avoid contains

Split/join
