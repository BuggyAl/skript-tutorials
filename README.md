# Introduction

### Welcome!&#x20;

This gitbook contains a crash course in Skript programming, so if you're here to learn, you're in the right place. This page contains the very basic overview of Skript, including installation and some basic ideas on how Skript works. We'll walk you through writing your first script, and hopefully get you more confident in using the language. After that, you can explore the rest of this site for more in-depth explanations and higher-level concepts. To get started, just click the `Installation` link at the bottom of this page.

For those of you who are already familiar with Skript, go ahead and use the navigation table on the left to jump to what you're interested in. Currently, only a few pages are actually complete, so you can use the links below to jump to completed tutorials. If you're interested in helping out, the github repo is linked on the right. Pull requests are welcome!

**Note:** These tutorials are for the current version of the SkriptLang Skript fork (2.6.3) and are not guaranteed to be correct for other versions or forks. This site does not include any tutorials for addons, either.
